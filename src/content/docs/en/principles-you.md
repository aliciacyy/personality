### Individualist

<ins>**You are most like The Individualist**</ins>

Individualists walk to the beat of their own drum and find unique ways of expressing themselves and their originality. They tend to be creative, independent, expressive, perceptive and at times sensitive and dramatic.

Individualists walk to the beat of their own drum and find unique ways of expressing themselves and their originality.

Typical Individualists make an art out of brushing aside tradition and conventions to do things their own way. They are always on the hunt for novel ways of doing things, defying the rules with a flare for the creative and sometimes for the dramatic. They are driven to express their individuality and don't let anyone else define who they are or dictate what they do.

Individualists tend to feel deeply and tap into an emotional layer that can drive their decisions and actions. At the same time, it can also mean they can be temperamental and experience self-doubt. They can be particularly sensitive to criticism.

Individualists tend to seek and appreciate things that are new, beautiful, and different. They have a talent for seeing things in a unique and thought-provoking way, and can chafe at being micromanaged or controlled.

At their best, they are highly creative, inspired, and bring a new and different perspective to any situation. However, they can tend to be reactive, withdrawn, and anxious in difficult situations, and sometimes can act out and be rebellious just for the sake of it, which can get in the way of their success and relationships with people who don't see things the same way as they do.

<ins>**Individualist Talents**</ins>

- Expressing uniqueness, creativity, and originality
- Disrupting the status quo and provoking new thinking in others
- Having the courage to think independently or be different
- Having a high degree of sensitivity and perceptiveness of others and the world around them

<ins>**Individualist Growth Needs**</ins>

- Experiencing moodiness and self-doubt
- Being rash and obstinate rather than measured and deliberate at times
- Knowing they are in control of their own destiny, not a victim of fate
- Taking constructive suggestions for improvement less personally

### Technician

Technicians are driven to break down, analyze and solve problems in a methodical and practical way. They tend to be precise, efficient, systematic and pragmatic.

Typical Technicians love examining how and why things work the way they do. They roll up their sleeves, take things apart, fix it when broken and put it back together. They pride themselves on being efficient and precise. They have an ability to analyze and dig behind problems and pick up on details and facts that others tend to overlook. They are methodical, practical, detail-oriented, and prefer a clear set of guidelines when setting out to complete tasks. They are impartial and clear headed in their analysis of information and base their judgments on objective reasoning more than emotions. They prefer using commonsensical, reality-tested approaches and straightforward thinking; they have less interest in whether something is new or interesting than whether it works.

Other distinguishing characteristics include a strong work ethic to pursue tasks and objectives with focus and resolve. Technicians take a planful, orderly, and precise approach to getting things done. They apply logic and reason to their thinking and rarely spend time thinking about people's quirks and tendencies. They may at times be more oriented to things than people.

Technicians may struggle to forge relationships with people who think differently—either those who are highly emotional or those who are too conceptual and idealistic. Their systematic and impartial approach to work and decisions can be perceived as overly rigid or detached by others who aren't inclined to see things the way they do.

<ins>**Technician Talents**</ins>

- Structured and technical problem solving
- Focusing on efficiency and reliability
- Being in command of facts and details
- Being precise and rarely making errors or mistakes
- Learning best from hands-on experience

<ins>**Technician Growth Needs**</ins>

- Appreciating more emergent and less systematic modes of thinking and problem solving
- Avoiding sometimes losing the forest for the trees
- Thinking more creatively and trying new approaches
- Learning to work with people with different personalities and skill sets

### Helper

Helpers are driven by compassion and care for others, and support of their emotional needs. They tend to be empathetic, nurturing, generous and agreeable.

Typical Helpers have a driving purpose to support the needs of others through their high capacity for compassion and empathy and their desire to give more than they receive. That starts with a deep appreciation for knowing where people are coming from and how emotions, feelings, and values shape behavior and outlooks. That capability is underscored by the special interest and time they take to really get to know people and make their lives better. They may experience difficulty confronting others with tough-minded, blunt criticism or when needing to draw a line in the sand or make their own demands. The people who know them best understand that they experience the world through their own emotional lens and that their intentions are always heartfelt and sincere. Their genuineness enables people to trust them fully.

Other distinguishing characteristics include their natural ability to give useful, common sense guidance. They tend to want to please others and seek harmony and understanding rather than conflict, debate, or disagreement. They may wear their hearts on their sleeves and struggle to hold others accountable, particularly people they feel a strong connection and loyalty to.

They give so much of themselves that they run the risk of depleting their own reservoir of energy. They can get pushed around emotionally and can feel under-appreciated by the very people they help. Because they may develop co-dependencies with the people they support, learning to say no, seeking support for themselves, and ending damaging relationships is central to maintaining their balance and ability to help others.

<ins>**Helper Talents**</ins>

- Offering warmth, kindness, empathy, and generosity
- Advising and giving support
- Good listener
- Accepting people for who they are, not overly judgmental
- Promoting harmony, win-win outcomes and teamwork

<ins>**Helper Growth Needs**</ins>

- Being direct and forthright with their own views when needed
- Can be too willing to take on other people's problems as their own
- Being less reactive to their and other people's feelings than the logic of a decision or outcome
- Being taken advantage of by others who are less giving than themselves

- Producers tend to be "Can do" people who are practical and pragmatic in dealing with everyday issues. They may be more technical than theoretical in their approach to challenging projects
